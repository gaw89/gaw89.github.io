title: Hello Github Pages!
---

Welcome to my Github Pages site.  The primary purpose of this site is to have a convenient place for me to document things I'm learning about so I can have an easy reference if I run into issues in the future.  Hopefully, by placing this info here, it may be helpful to others as well.  Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Barry Clark</a> for providing the excellent Jekyll Now so I don't have to spend time learning how to set up Jekyll from scratch!
